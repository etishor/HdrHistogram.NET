    /**
     * {@link WriterReaderPhaser} instances provide an asymmetric means for synchronizing the execution of
     * wait-free "writer" critical sections against a "reader phase flip" that needs to make sure no writer critical
     * sections that were active at the beginning of the flip are still active after the flip is done. Multiple writers
     * and multiple readers are supported.
     * <p>
     * While a {@link WriterReaderPhaser} can be useful in multiple scenarios, a specific and common use case is
     * that of safely managing "double buffered" data stream access in which writers can proceed without being
     * blocked, while readers gain access to stable and unchanging buffer samples
     * <blockquote>
     * NOTE: {@link WriterReaderPhaser} writers are wait-free on architectures that support wait-free atomic
     * increment operations. They remain lock-free (but not wait-free) on architectures that do not support
     * wait-free atomic increment operations.
     * </blockquote>
     * {@link WriterReaderPhaser} "writers" are wait free, "readers" block for other "readers", and
     * "readers" are only blocked by "writers" whose critical was entered before the reader's
     * {@link WriterReaderPhaser#flipPhase()} attempt.
     * <p>
     * When used to protect an actively recording data structure, the assumptions on how readers and writers act are:
     * <ol>
     * <li>There are two sets of data structures ("active" and "inactive")</li>
     * <li>Writing is done to the perceived active version (as perceived by the writer), and only
     *     within critical sections delineated by {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionEnter}
     *     and {@link WriterReaderPhaser#writerCriticalSectionExit}).</li>
     * <li>Only readers switch the perceived roles of the active and inactive data structures.
     *     They do so only while under readerLock(), and only before calling flipPhase().</li>
     * </ol>
     * When the above assumptions are met, {@link WriterReaderPhaser} guarantees that the inactive data structures are not
     * being modified by any writers while being read while under readerLock() protection after a flipPhase()
     * operation.
     *
